<http://www.pythonchallenge.com/> from 2005 says it is *the first programming riddle on the net*.
It is a series of puzzles that can be solved with any programming language. This repository is just my solutions using Python. The fun part for me has been learning different Python libraries.

Update July 2020: I stopped at level 18 where data for two PNG image files is found. The solution is to use difflib, but even searching for other people's solutions didn't explain how they ended up figuring out the correct method. I would have wasted a lot of time subtracting, XOR'ing and trying other manipulations on the pixel values. I may or may not continue with remaining levels at some point.
